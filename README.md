RankUp
========
RankUp is a comically full-featured prison ranking plugin. It allows players upgrade their ranking using a certain amount of money. To manage ranks, RankUp comes with a built in group manager called DoesGroups. You can also use PurePerms to manage ranks. RankUp comes with support for both EconomyS and PocketMoney for a currency.
